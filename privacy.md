## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: December 29, 2024

### Introduction

This Chrome extension, called PCS-Note-Cleaner (the “Extension”), is designed to remove items containing “Required by <date>” from the new.precisionconference.com submissions page if the date is in the past and optionally to allow users to set a “fake today” date.

We take your privacy seriously. This document outlines what limited data the Extension may store, how it is used, and your control over it.

### Information We Collect
1. User-Chosen Date
  - If you select the “Use a Specific Date” option in the Extension’s popup, the Extension stores that date string (e.g., “2025-10-05”) using Chrome’s local storage (chrome.storage.local). This allows your preference to persist across browser sessions.
  - If you choose “Use Real System Date,” no date is stored permanently (we store only the preference key indicating your choice).
2. No Personal or Browsing Data
  - The Extension does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information. It does not track your browsing history or keystrokes or gather analytics data.

### How We Use the Information
- Local Storage
- The user-chosen date and setting are only used locally to determine if a “Required by <date>” item should be hidden.
- This data remains private to your device and is never sent to external servers.

### Data Sharing and Transfers
- We do not sell, trade, or transfer your stored preferences to third parties.
- We do not use any external analytics or data-logging services.

### Security
- Exposure risk is minimal because the Extension only stores your date preference locally and does not transmit it elsewhere.
- We recommend taking standard precautions with your device (e.g., secure your browser profile and use updated antivirus software).

### Your Choices
- You can uninstall the Extension at any time to remove its functionality.
- You can also open Chrome’s extension local storage via Developer Tools to manually clear or modify the stored date.

### Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our operations or legal requirements.
- We will provide the updated date at the top of the policy.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Extension, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us via the repository’s contact details.
